# Email-Spam-Detection-Model
Developed an Email Spam Detection Model using Logistic Regression to classify emails as spam or not spam. The project involved importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, nltk, and Matplotlib. The dataset was loaded and preprocessed by removing special characters, stop words, and applying stemming/lemmatization to ensure data quality. Text data was then converted into numerical form using TfidfVectorizer. The data was split into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance. Utilizing the LogisticRegression() function from sklearn, I trained the model and made predictions. The model's accuracy was evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive assessment of its classification capabilities.
